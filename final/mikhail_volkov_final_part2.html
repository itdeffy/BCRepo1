            <b>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</b><br>
            I had a basic understanding of web development and html/css/javascript as my dad taought me the basics and I had a web development class in middle school which I couldn't finish as I moved states.<br>
            <b>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</b><br>
            I built my portfolio from scratch as I wanted to really see how much I learned.<br>
            <b>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</b><br>
            The hardest part of the portfolio for me was styling and making sure the pages are all tidy with centerings and sizes as well as the colors for the theme.<br>
            <b>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </b><br>
            Its a very difficult and time consuming process and makes me appreciate good looking websites way more.<br>
            <b>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</b><br>
            I think its pretty useful to know how to make websites since the internet is becoming more and more common.<br>
