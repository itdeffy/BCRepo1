                    Before going into this class I had a basic understading of HTML as my dad tought me the basics a while ago. After completing the class I gained a more general understanding of how websites function and how to make them using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

                Instructor: Jamiiru Luttamaguzi
                <p>
                    I had a very small understanding of integrals as they were defined. I took<br>MATH 151 and at the end my instructor talked about integrals briefly. This course taught me a lot about integrals and why they are important as well as how to solve the different kinds of integrals.
