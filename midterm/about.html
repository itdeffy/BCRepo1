        <h2 class="subpageH2">My name is Mikhail and I am a running start student at Bellevue College.<br>
            I like coding and playing video games as well as editing videos about different topics that interest me at the time.<br>
            In college I plan to continue learning about computers and different programming languages.<br>
            After finishing college I will continue learning to code and develop video games.<br>
            I hope to become a successful indie game developer or work elsewhere with computers. <br>
            This website is me learning about web development and working on a longer project that I enjoy.
